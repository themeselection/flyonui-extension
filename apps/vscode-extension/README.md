## About the project

This extension is a fork of [Stagewise](https://github.com/stagewise-io/stagewise).

Welcome to **FlyonUI IDE Extension** — the tool for developers who want to make UI changes without context switching.

- 💬 Tell what you want to change
- 🧠 Click on element(s) to let the agent know where a change should happen
- 💡 Let FlyonUI IDE Extension do the magic!

You can also use the FlyonUI Blocks from the toolbar and from the extension window to insert them directly into your project.

> Perfect for devs tired of pasting element information and folder paths into prompts. FlyonUI IDE Extension uses real-time, browser-powered context.

## Features

- ⚡ Works out of the box
- 📖 Open source
- ⛓️ Compatible with all kinds of frameworks
- 🧠 Compatible with all IDEs and AI Agents
- 🚀 Access to all the FlyonUI Blocks from the FlyonUI Toolbar and IDE Extension

## What is the FlyonUI IDE extension?

This extension connects the FlyonUI toolbar to agents included in many popular IDEs and extensions.

When you start the FlyonUI CLI, the toolbar will search for other agents running locally.

This way, you can use the FlyonUI toolbar to select elements and provide context to your AI agent without switching between your IDE and browser.

Apart from this, you can also use the FlyonUI Blocks from the toolbar to use them directly in your project.
